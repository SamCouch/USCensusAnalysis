# USCensusAnalysis

This project was created to teach give myself more experience in visualising GIS data and machine learning.
It involves the analysis of US Census data at the county level.
It is split into two parts, Part A focuses on the visualisation of this data, while Part B focuses on analysing the data and drawing insights using machine learning methods.
These parts were laid out in two notebooks created using Jupyter.
These notebooks can be seen by either downloading and running the ipython notebooks in Jupyter, or by downloading the html files and running them in a web browser.
